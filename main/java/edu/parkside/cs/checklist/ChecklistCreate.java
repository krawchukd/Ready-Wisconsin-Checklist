 *
 *        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

 *        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 *        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 *        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 *
 *        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

 *        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 *        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 *        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 *
 *        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

 *        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 *        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 *        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 *        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *        as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *        meet the following conditions:
 *
 *        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *        stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *        the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *        as modifying the License.
 *
 *        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *        the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
 *        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
