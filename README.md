Ready-Wisconsin-Checklist
User created checklists for Emergency Readiness Kits, also known as "Go-Kits".

My contribution to the Ready Wisconsin Android application project, hosted by the UW-Parkside Computer Science Department under the direction of Dr. Riley. I authored the checklists portion of the application which is currently still under development.

The JavaDoc for the checklist package is under the directory of Android-Ready-Wisconsin-Checklist. You should start at the index.html file within the directory for a quick look at the package contents.

A video of the checklists in action can be seen at krawchukd.tumblr.com
